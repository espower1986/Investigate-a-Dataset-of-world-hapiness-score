# Investigate-a-Dataset-of-world-hapiness-score
In this project we use The data obtained from Gapminder World https://www.gapminder.org/data/ to analyze happiness score around the world as dependent variable, This is the national average response to the question of life evaluations asking the following “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder In order to find out influences on this score, 4 independents variables are used: -Income: Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 prices, PPP based on 2011 ICP).  -Democracy index:This index is using the data from the Economist Inteligence Unit to express the quality of democracies as a number between 0 and 100. It's based on 60 different aspects of societies that are relevant to democracy universal suffrage for all adults, voter participation, perception of human rights protection and freedom to form organizations and parties. The democracy index is calculated from the 60 indicators, divided into five "sub indexes", which are:  Electoral pluralism index; Government index; Political participation indexm; Political culture index; Civil liberty index. The sub-indexes are based on the sum of scores on roughly 12 indicators per sub-index, converted into a score between 0 and 100.
